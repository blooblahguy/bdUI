# Task-Driven Development

**Breaking Down Large Features into Manageable Tasks**

## **PRD Development First**
- **Ask clarifying questions** to understand requirements
- **Research similar implementations** and best practices
- **Create comprehensive Product Requirements Document**
- **Define success criteria** and acceptance tests

## **Task Breakdown**
- **Create TASKS.md** in the feature folder
- **Break down into logical, manageable tasks**
- **Assign priorities** (P0, P1, P2, P3)
- **Identify dependencies** between tasks
- **Estimate complexity and effort**

## **Research & Planning**
- **Use research tools** to understand complexity
- **Investigate existing patterns** in codebase
- **Research external libraries** and approaches
- **Document findings and decisions**

## **Task Management**
- **Track status**: TODO, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED, DONE
- **Update task status** as work progresses
- **Add notes and blockers** to tasks
- **Re-prioritize** based on discoveries

## **Implementation Strategy**
- **Start with highest priority, lowest dependency tasks**
- **Create minimal viable implementations** first
- **Build incrementally** with working code
- **Test each task completion**

## Examples

```markdown
# DON'T: Jumping straight into code
"I need a new payment system"
# *starts coding immediately*

# DO: Task-driven approach
"I need a new payment system"
# 1. Create PRD with requirements
# 2. Research payment providers
# 3. Break down into tasks
# 4. Start with highest priority
```

```markdown
# DON'T: No task organization
# Just start coding without plan

# DO: Structured task breakdown
# TASKS.md
## P0 - Core Payment Integration
- [ ] Research Stripe vs Square APIs
- [ ] Design payment flow architecture
- [ ] Implement basic payment service

## P1 - Security & Validation
- [ ] Add input validation
- [ ] Implement security measures
- [ ] Add error handling
```

```markdown
# DON'T: No research or planning
# Assume approach without investigation

# DO: Research-driven decisions
# Research: Stripe vs Square comparison
# Decision: Use Stripe for better Django integration
# Documentation: Decision recorded in PRD
```
